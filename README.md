# PMAP - Perception and Mapping Curricular Unit

This repository contains the projects and practical classes for the **Perception and Mapping** curricular unit.


## Repository Structure

### **Proj1 - ICP Implementation**
This folder contains the implementation of the **Iterative Closest Point (ICP)** algorithm. ICP is a widely used algorithm for aligning two point clouds by iteratively minimizing the distance between corresponding points.

### **Proj2 - 3D Object Registration and SLAM**
This project is divided into two parts: **3D Object Registration** and **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**.

#### **Part 1: 3D Object Registration**
This part focuses on registering 3D objects using point cloud data. The goal is to align multiple views of an object into a unified coordinate system.

#### **Part 2: SLAM**
This part implements a basic **SLAM** system, which is crucial for autonomous navigation and mapping in robotics.

### **TP - Practical Classes**
This folder contains the code and materials from the practical classes. These classes focus on implementing and improving various perception and mapping techniques.
